# HelpLuc

Program generating random scenarios to stimulate Luc Besson's creativity (with french comments).


# How does it work ?

Luc Besson, the movie director, ran out of inspiration. The program is meant to stimulate his creativity by suggesting him random scenarios.

- Several main characters, actions, other characters and places are set.

- Luc Besson can ask for a random scenario.

- The program randomly picks a main character who makes an action concerning an other character in a place.

- The scenario is suggested to Luc Besson. For example, wouldn't you go watch a movie about a yamakasi saving an oyster in an airport ?

- If Luc Besson is not sure about the idea, he can keep asking for a new scenario until he likes what the program suggests.
